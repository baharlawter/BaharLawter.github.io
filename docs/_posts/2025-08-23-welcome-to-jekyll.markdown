Welcome to my portfolio site! I'm Bahar Lawter, a former educator with over 10 years of experience who has transitioned into software engineering.

This blog will share my journey from teaching math to building software, including insights from my studies, projects, and career growth. I’m passionate about problem-solving, lifelong learning, and creating technology that helps others.

Stay tuned for updates on my progress, tips for career changers, and stories from my experience in both education and tech.

Thank you for visiting!
Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
