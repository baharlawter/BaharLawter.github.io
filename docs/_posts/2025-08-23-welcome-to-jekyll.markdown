# Welcome!

I'm **Bahar Lawter**, a former school teacher now pursuing a career as a full-stack developer. This site is where I share my journey, showcase my projects, and connect with others passionate about technology and learning.

Here you'll find:

- My latest projects and achievements
- Updates on my learning progress and new skills
- Ways to connect and collaborate

Feel free to explore my [Projects](/project-work/), view my [Resume](/resume/), or [Contact Me](/contact/) if you'd like to connect!

Thanks for visiting and supporting my journey!
