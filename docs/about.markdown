  <div class="about-text">

    I began my professional journey as a math teacher, where I discovered my love for problem-solving and helping others learn. Today, I'm pursuing a new path as a software engineer through LaunchCode — combining my analytical skills with a passion for building.



    My technical toolkit includes:
    - JavaScript, HTML/CSS
    - Java Spring Boot
    - React
    - SQL Server
    - Git & GitHub

    I'm excited to grow in this field and create tools that make life easier and more connected.

  <div class="about-text">

    I'm originally from Turkmenistan and now proudly a U.S. citizen living with my husband and our three amazing kids.

    Family is my foundation — they inspire me to work hard, stay curious, and never stop learning. Whether it's weekend adventures, bedtime stories, or sharing meals, our home is full of love and laughter.
