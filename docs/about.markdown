    ## Career  
    I began my professional journey as a math teacher, where I discovered my love for problem-solving and helping others learn. Today, I'm pursuing a new path as a software engineer through LaunchCode — combining my analytical skills with a passion for building.  
    <br><br>
    My technical toolkit includes:  
    - JavaScript, HTML/CSS  
    - Java Spring Boot  
    - React  
    - SQL Server  
    - Git & GitHub  
    <br>
    I'm excited to grow in this field and create tools that make life easier and more connected.

    ## Home Life  
    I'm originally from Turkmenistan and now proudly a U.S. citizen living with my husband and our three amazing kids.  
    <br><br>
    Family is my foundation — they inspire me to work hard, stay curious, and never stop learning. Whether it's weekend adventures, bedtime stories, or sharing meals, our home is full of love and laughter.

    ## Education  
    My academic roots are in mathematics, which taught me discipline, logic, and the beauty of patterns.  
    <br><br>
    Now, I'm expanding those foundations through LaunchCode’s software engineering program — diving deep into modern technologies and collaborative development. Every day brings new challenges and new victories.
