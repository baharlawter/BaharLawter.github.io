# From Classroom to Code: My Transition Story

Hello and welcome to my portfolio! I'm excited to share my journey from being a mathematics teacher to pursuing a career in software engineering.

## The Decision to Change

After 10+ years in education, I found myself drawn to the logical problem-solving aspects of programming. Teaching mathematics had already given me a strong foundation in analytical thinking, and I realized that coding was a natural extension of those skills.

## Why Software Engineering?

- **Problem-solving**: Just like in math, programming is about breaking down complex problems into manageable pieces
- **Creativity**: Building applications allows me to create tools that can help people
- **Continuous learning**: The tech industry's constant evolution matches my love for learning
- **Impact**: Technology has the power to reach and help more people than I could in a single classroom

## What I'm Learning

Through LaunchCode's program, I'm diving deep into:

- **Frontend Development**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React
- **Backend Development**: Java and Spring Boot
- **Database Management**: SQL Server
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub
- **Problem-solving methodologies**: Applying my mathematical background to coding challenges

## The Journey Ahead

This transition isn't just about changing careers—it's about combining my passion for helping others with my love for logical thinking and technology. I'm excited to build applications that make a difference.

Stay tuned for more updates as I continue this exciting journey!
